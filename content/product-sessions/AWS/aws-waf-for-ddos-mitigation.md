## WHY

Implementing a WAF can be tricky: we are used to pre-packaged solutions, which come with a lot of false positives. In this hands-on session we'll use a different approach and work on some automations to dynamically create rules to protect your applications.

## What

Based on the AWS Security Automations packaged solution, we'll explore differet mechanisms and tricks to protect our services from some common, and many uncommon types of attacks.

## Outcomes

You will hopefully learn the basics and some pro tips to go ahead and integrate WAF in your existing environment.
