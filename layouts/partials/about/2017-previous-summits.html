            <br/>Building on the legacy of the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008" target="_blank">2008</a> and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011" target="_blank">2011</a> Summits in Portugal, the <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/" target="blank">OWASP Summit 2017</a> moved to its current home of Woburn Forest Center Parcs, in Bedfordshire, just one hour from London.<br/><br/>
            With 16 tracks and over 170 working sessions, the Summit saw collaborative working, fantastic team dynamics, long days, and longer nights. The 200+ participants, both attending in person and remotely, produced some exceptional tangible outcomes, including the <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/Mobile-Security/MSTG.html" target="blank">Mobile Security Testing Guide</a>.<br/><br/>
            The outcomes also included improving the <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/Threat-Model/Threat-Model-Owasp-Pages.html" target="blank">OWASP Threat Modelling pages</a>, <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/CISO/Application-Security-Guide-for-CISO.html" target="blank">the Application Security Guide For CISOs</a> and <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/Playbooks/Security-Playbooks-Diagrams.html" target="blank">Security Playbooks Diagrams</a>.<br/><br/>
            Teams also looked at how best to visualise the information contained in a <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/Playbooks/Security-Playbooks-Diagrams.html" target="blank">playbook</a>, building a <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/Threat-Model/Lightweight-Threat-Modeling-Process.html" target="blank">lightweight (bottom up) threat model</a> and the <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/CISO/The-future-of-privacy.html" target="blank">Future of Privacy</a>.<br/><br/>
            Details of all the <a href="https://owaspsummit.org/Outcomes/" target="blank">2017 outcomes</a> are available via the OWASP Summit 2017 website.
